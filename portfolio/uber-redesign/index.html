      Empowering long distance travellers to plan trips together

    <div class="main-text">
      When I tried using uberPOOL for the first time a couple of months ago in Toronto, I became an instant fan. Sharing a car
      with someone else, personally, was totally worth the convenience of better price. UberPOOL’s mission of cutting congestion,
      pollution and parking by turning every car into a shared car aligns with how I believe the world is going to work in
      the future with the introduction of driverless cars. One way that I believe Uber should expand their outreach of this
      initiative is by focusing on the needs of unique niche markets and then once the system is perfected, expand to other
      markets with similar needs. One specific market that I have found reason to believe has potential is focusing on university
      students. Below I have put together a case study for how Uber could expand its efforts in uberPOOL.

      The transportation system that students use to travel between home and university is flawed in many ways. Focusing on the
      province of Ontario in Canada, a large proportion of students going to university in Ontario are from the city of Toronto.
      In fact, roughly 50% of the population of Ontario lives in Toronto. With this many people having a home in the city
      of Toronto, it is a common occurrence to have university students needing a way to go back and forth from their university
      and home. Personally, like the large majority of students at University of Waterloo, as a student living in Toronto,
      Canada, I very frequently have to experience the burden of organizing a ride for myself to or from school. Currently,

    <div class="main-text">
      <p>
        While there are a few possible options for travelling to and from university, the main downside to the reasonably-priced
        existing options is that students must find their own transportation to one of the 2 pick-up locations within the
        city of Toronto. This is especially difficult for international students who don’t have family to drive them to a
        nearby pick-up location and therefore end up requiring to also take an additional mode of transportation, such as
        public transit to their nearest pick-up location. As outlined below, students are wanting a to be picked-up from
        a location that is not far from their current location while keeping a reasonable price. This has naturally introduced
        the uprising of students sharing rides, who connect through Facebook, within the past few years which has brought
        along a few problems of its own.

        The fastest growing option amongst students, nowadays, is students connecting with other students through a ridesharing group

        major universities in the province of Ontario have active ridesharing groups where students can connect with each
        other. While this is currently the best option for most students, it is nowhere near a perfect system and many improvements
        can be made in favor of both student drivers and riders.

      Solving this problem to support Uber's mission
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      <p>
        From my previous internships, I have found that it is important to always know the overall business goals of any project
        initiative within a company. The 3 important areas that I have found can help push new projects forward is by focusing
        on how a new initiative can: stem losses, increase revenue or help the company be a leader in their industry by introducing
        new product capabilities. The following demonstrates the business objectives that a project like this would positively
        impact Uber’s bottom line.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="process_subsection">
      New Users
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      By focusing on university students as the target market for this project Uber will be able to capture more of the upcoming,
      younger generation of consumers.
    </div>

    <div class="process_subsection">
      Increased engagement
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      Similar to uberCOMMUTE, this project allows Uber to benefit from users coming back and using the platform since drivers and
      riders who consistently travel to and from school and enjoy the experience will return whenever they plan a trip. This
      benefit of having recurring user engagement could also result in drivers and users could be a good way of introducing
      new users to the platform who may have not been previously open to using Uber products.
    </div>

    <div class="process_subsection">
      Greater environmental impact
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      Introducing this project would contribute towards uberPOOL’s mission of cutting congestion and pollution on the roads since
      student drivers who previously would drive to and from school by themselves would now be sharing their vehicle with
      other people.
    </div>

    <div class="process_subsection">
      Industry leadership
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      Finally, this initiative would enable Uber to further its presence as an industry leader by introducing a new means of providing
      reliable transportation to an area that no notable company has successfully solved.

      User Goals

    <div class="section-sub-subheader case-study">
      Student riders and drivers collectively want a better way to come together
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      During the market research phase, I noticed that not only do student riders want a way to connect with drivers but student
      drivers who have already planned a trip to travel a far distance are also interested in being able to connect with
      potential riders. This is demonstrated when student drivers on ridesharing groups make postings indicating that they
      are travelling a certain direction and ask if there are any riders that are interested in joining. This therefore proved
      there to be 2 types of students that would benefit from being able to connect over Uber for long distance trips to
      and from school.

      For most of my design projects, before diving into figuring out how anything is going to be designed, I try to stay as low-fidelity

      overall architecture of the project integrates well with the rest of the project. In the below user-task flows I attempted
      to find the optimal workflow that balanced a great user-experience, by requiring the least amount of user input, and
      technical effort, while respecting the good design work that Uber already created.
