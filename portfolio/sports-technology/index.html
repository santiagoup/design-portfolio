      Empowering people to train for sports better
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      As a big fan of playing basketball and hockey and growing up wanting master these sports, I remember multiple times searching
      for and buying new sports equipment to up my game. Even nowadays, after seeing a favorite athlete of mine using a cool
      sports technology product, I often look up what it is on the internet to see if it is worth buying and if there are
      any other similar products made by the same company that might be of interest. To aid in this process of discovering
      new sports technology products and learning more about my favorite athletes, as a side project, I tried designing the
      end to end mobile experience for a product I wish I had myself and the following case study demonstrates the steps
      I took towards designing the final product.
    </div>
    <div class="section-subheader">
      The Problem
    </div>

    <div class="section-sub-subheader case-study">
      There are no notable platforms that show regular people how professional athletes train
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      I began my discovery process by first thinking about what sort of problems I could solve that would work towards improving
      my performance in sports. My two favorite hobbies are playing hockey and basketball and I also enjoy watching professional
      sports. Thinking about how I enjoy reading about athletes and how they train to inform how I work out, I realized how
      much effort it is to learn about how professional athletes train and that there is no central hub for learning about
      athletes’ lives with regards to training. I believe there is so much to learn from professional athletes that know
      how to train properly since researchers are always looking into how athletes can enhance performance and optimize recovery.
      If only there was a way for us all to learn how to recover better and faster without the need of a professional contract.
    </div>

    <div class="section-subheader">
      The Goal
    </div>

    <div class="section-sub-subheader case-study">
      Provide a consolodated solution that provides the means for regular people to train like pro athletes
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      Through understanding that the root of the problem is that every day people don’t have access to the worlds’ top knowledge
      or tools towards become healthier and better at sports, I concluded that it was worth creating a product that could
      provide insight into how professional athletes train and how everyday people could train like the pros as well. Specific
      goals that I then came up with that I wanted to achieve with this app would be to allow users to personalize what sports
      they want to learn more about how to train better, next would be users to follow their specific professionals so that
      they can train like their favorite athlete. The final step that I wanted to allow users to be able to achieve was to
      be able to be able to use the app has an end-to-end ecommerce platform where users could shortlist and purchase products
      directly from the app.

    <div class="section-subheader">
      User Stories and Epics
    </div>

    <div class="section-sub-subheader case-study">
      Breaking down tasks user should be able to complete
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      <p>
        In attempt to prioritize the end user’s point of view, many times I like to lay out all the tasks a user may want to complete
        in the form of user stories and epics. I use user stories to fully grasp what functionality should be visible to
        end users by breaking down each task into the smallest form that would provide value to the user. I then use epics,
        which encompass many user stories, to provide an overview of the features of the product. This phase of putting together
        user stories and epics is a helpful way for me to evaluate design decisions and create a useful user experience.
      </p>

      User Task Flow
    </div>

    <div class="section-sub-subheader case-study">
      Organizing when each task should be presented to the user
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      <p>
        Next after evaluating what tasks need to be designed from creating user stories and epics, I like to organize each task into
        a high-level user task flow. Creating a user task flow helps think through the overall architecture of the product
        before any features are designed. Furthermore, crafting a user task flow helps think in terms of a user working through
        the flow of the application, and helps with determining if the conceptual model agrees with the user model.

      Wireframing

    <div class="section-sub-subheader case-study">
      Experimenting with different components to inform the optimal user experience
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      <p>
        My next step before diving into designing high-fidelity mockups was to visualize the user task flow. For each step in the
        user task flow, I quickly sketched some wireframes of what each step could possibly look like which helped with brainstorming
        how users would interact with each part of the application. This final step before beginning defining the final user
        interface was helpful in realizing different edge cases that a user may run into as well as helped with thinking
        about what the user experience should when encountering an error.

      Final Design
    </div>

    <div class="section-sub-subheader case-study">
      Iterating towards a desirable final product
    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      <p>
        At this point, I was ready to iterate the wireframes into a form that would be simple to use and intuitive to potential users.
        This became a major theme of focusing on making simplicity a top priority because efficiency was a main value proposition
        since users already can search online for sports products themselves. However, having all information about sports
        training consolidated into one app would become the differentiator over other available solutions.
